# Angular2 Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate application for Angular2 apps. The following technologies are included and integrated:

* Angular2
* Angular2 Routing
* PugJS (2.0.0 BETA)
* SASS
* Karma/Jasmine
* TSLint/Codelyzer

## Angular2 Routing

A basic skeleton for Angular2's routing is included, with a single 'index' component being used.

## PugJS 

PugJS is a template engine that webpack compiles down to regular HTML. 

Using PugJS, we can create mixins, variables, and other goodies inside of our component templates.

## SASS

SASS is a superset of CSS. Much like Pug, we use webpack to compile it down to regular CSS.

Benefits include: mixins, variables, inheritance, nesting, and much more.

## Karma/Jasmine

Karma is used to run our frontend unit tests (*.spec.ts files). 

Jasmine is used to write the frontend unit tests, which Karma can then run. 

## TSLint/Codelyzer

TSLint goes through all of our TypeScript code and checks to ensure best practices are being used across the project. 

Codelyzer is a sort of addon to TSLint for Angular2 applications. It has configurable options that Angular2 code within the project will need to adhere to.
