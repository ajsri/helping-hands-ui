#Helping Hands

Helping Hands is a single page application designed for [Globalhack VI](https://globalhack.org/),
which was held from 21OCT16 to 23OCT16. The hackathon's theme was 'homelessness', which sought
solutions to four separate problems:

1. Prevention
2. Emergency Shelter
3. Electronic Referrals/Data Sharing
4. Data Visualization

##Getting Started

This is solely for UI setup. For RESTful services... well, we're not going to cover that. This project
will be updated to include an option to use mock data from static JSON files.

###Prerequisites
You will need the latest version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) installed.

###Installation
Clone the repository, navigate to that directory and run `npm install` and `typings install`.

###Usage
Run `npm run start` from the command line to run a local webpack development server. Any changes you make
will cause the page to be reloaded.
